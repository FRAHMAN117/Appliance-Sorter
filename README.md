# Appliance Management System
## Overview
### This project is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage and display a list of appliances. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction and robust file-handling capabilities to read appliance data from a text file. The system uses an object-oriented approach to model different types of appliances, validates data upon entry, and allows users to search for appliances based on specific criteria.
